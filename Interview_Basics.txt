Data Types and Structures: Understand value vs. reference types, collections (List, Dictionary, HashSet), and arrays.
LINQ: Be ready to demonstrate your knowledge of LINQ queries, including methods like Select, Where, GroupBy, Join, etc.
Asynchronous Programming: Understand async/await, Task, Thread, and ThreadPool.
2. .NET Framework Specifics
Garbage Collection: How it works in .NET, and what IDisposable and using are used for.
Exception Handling: Best practices for error handling, custom exceptions, and the use of try, catch, finally.
Dependency Injection: Familiarize yourself with how DI works in .NET and ASP.NET Core.

Routing: Know how routing works in MVC, including attribute routing and custom routes.
Action Results: Understand different types of Action Results like ViewResult, JsonResult, RedirectResult, etc.
Model Binding and Validation: Be ready to discuss how models are bound in MVC, as well as client-side and server-side validation.
Security: Knowledge of authentication and authorization, especially using ASP.NET Identity, is crucial.
4. Entity Framework
Code First vs. Database First: Understand the difference and when to use each.
Migrations: How to manage database schema changes using migrations.
LINQ to Entities: Be able to write and optimize queries using Entity Framework.
5. Practical Coding Problems
Problem Solving: Practice coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal to get comfortable with algorithmic thinking.
Design Patterns: Understand common design patterns like Singleton, Repository, Factory, and how they are implemented in C#.
6. Project Experience
Be prepared to discuss your past projects, especially those relevant to ASP.NET MVC and C#. Focus on challenges you faced, how you overcame them, and the impact your work had.
7. Behavioral Questions
Prepare for questions about teamwork, problem-solving, dealing with tight deadlines, etc.
8. Mock Interviews
Consider doing a few mock interviews with a friend or using platforms like Pramp to simulate the interview experience.
